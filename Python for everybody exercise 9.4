# 9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as
 the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced,
 the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.
 
name = input('Enter file:')
handle = open(name)

counts = dict()
for line in handle:
    words = line.split()
    if len(words) < 1 or words[0] != 'From':
        continue
    counts[words[1]] = counts.get(words[1], 0) + 1

new_val = None
new_kee = None
for kee, val in counts.items():
    if new_val is None or val > new_val:
        new_kee = kee
        new_val = val
print(new_val, new_kee)
